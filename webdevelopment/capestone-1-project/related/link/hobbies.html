    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>
        <br>Coding is not just a pastime for me; it's a passion that allows me to explore the boundless world of
        technology and creativity.
        <br> Delving into lines of code feels like solving intricate puzzles
        <br>where every semicolon and bracket contributes to the creation of something meaningful.
        <br> Whether it's developing web applications, designing algorithms, or crafting elegant solutions to complex
        problems</br>
        <br> Coding is my gateway to transforming ideas into functional and tangible results.
